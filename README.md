# FacialRecognition
This script performs real-time face recognition through your webcam. It uses the Facenet model from the DeepFace library to compare live face embeddings with reference images and displays the matched identity on the video feed.
# Real-Time Face Recognition

This project uses DeepFace and OpenCV to perform real-time face recognition through a webcam.

## Features
- Detects and identifies faces from live webcam feed.
- Matches against multiple reference images.
- Uses Facenet model for embeddings.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:

## Reference Images
Place your images in the project folder and update the paths in the code accordingly.
